## 1. Specification and High-Level Modeling

-   First, the **specifications** (the list of requirements the chip must meet) are defined.
-   These specifications are then checked for implementability. This can be modeled and verified at a high level using a language like **C** and a compiler like **GCC** in a Linux environment.

## 2. Hardware Implementation using Verilog

To implement the hardware, a Hardware Description Language (HDL) like **Verilog** is used. This allows designers to describe how the hardware should behave to meet the specifications. This stage is often divided into two main parts: the processor and the peripherals.

### Processor Design
-   This involves the gate-level design of the processor core.
-   The Verilog code written for the processor must be **synthesizable**, meaning it can be converted directly into logic gates. It should not contain non-synthesizable constructs.

### Peripherals and IP Integration
-   This stage involves integrating macros and analog IPs.
-   **Macros** are reusable and synthesizable blocks of logic.
-   **Analog IPs** (like PLLs or ADCs) are non-synthesizable blocks that are treated as black boxes.

## 3. Physical Design and Fabrication

-   Once the design is integrated, the **SOC Engineer** rechecks the results to ensure everything is correct.
-   The final design is then sent to a fabrication foundry for manufacturing. This process is called **tapeout**.
-   After the manufacturing process is complete, the foundry returns the physical silicon chip. This is called **tape in**.
-   The manufactured chip is then placed in a device and tested to check its functionality and ensure it meets the required clock frequency.

---

## 4. Verification and Consistency

-   A critical principle in chip design is that the output must be the same at every stage of the flow (e.g., the C-model, Verilog simulation, and post-synthesis netlist should all produce identical results).
-   If any step produces a different result, the design process must return to the point of divergence and be corrected.
